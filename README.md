# Welcome-to-Demon-School-Iruma-kun---Data-Analytics
A little "Just-For-Fun"-Project with the aim of searching trough the data available of the manga series "Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun" and creating fun insights of the contend available. Data will be requested of the Fandom-Wiki.


Visual Data Analysis
I used Python to query the data of all the chapters available on the Fandom wiki and extracted the "Characters by Appearance" section to create the charts above.
DISCLAIMER: As of today (01 October 2025) 296/413 Chapters (71.67%) are available on Fandom. I have NO DATA for the missing chapters!

Here are some insights into the available data:
Number of unique Characters = ~208
Chapter with the ...
... highest number of Characters = Ch. 236 -> 43 Characters (Heartbreaker Intro)
... lowest number of Characters = Ch. 94 -> 2 Characters (Iruma, Ameri)
--> Median number of characters per chapter = ~ 13 Characters
Most frequent appearances of a ...
Non-Misfit character = Azazel Ameri
Non-Student character = Naberius Kalego
Non-Babyls character = Barbatos Bachiko
All 13 Misfits are within the top 20 most frequent characters. The Soulmates Iruma Suzuki, Asmodeus Alice and Valac Clara take the top 3.
Allocer Schneider and Purson Soi are the least frequently appearing Misfits. 
For Purson Soi, this is hardly surprising given his late (real) introduction and being a background character for much of the story. Allocer Schneider, however, has no such excuseâ€”appearing in 17 chapters fewer than the next Misfit character, which is somewhat interesting.
